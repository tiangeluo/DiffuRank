## Overall
- Install with `pip install -e .`. Please make sure you download the shap-E code from this repo as there are modifications compared to the original repo. 

## Extract latents
We provide the code necessary to extract the shape latent code, should you need to apply it to your own 3D objects. Objaverse shapE latent codes are provided on our [dataset page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiange/Cap3D/tree/main/misc/ShapELatentCode_zips). 

Please run `python extract_latent.py` and the results will be saved at `./extracted_shapE_latent`. You can look at the example files to see how to apply it to your own data.
